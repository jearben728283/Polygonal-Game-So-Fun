# Polygonal-Game-So-Fun

A polygon game is a single-player game that starts with a polygon of n vertices. Each vertex is assigned an integer value, and each edge is given an operator "+" or "*". All the edges are numbered from 1 to n in turn using integers.

In the first step of the game, delete an edge.

Subsequent n-1 steps operate as follows:

(1) Select an edge E and two vertices V1 and V2 connected by E;

(2) Replace the edge E and the two vertices V1 and V2 connected by E with a new vertex. The new vertices are given the results of the operations on edge E of the vertices V1 and V2.

Finally, all sides are deleted and the game ends. The score of the game is the integer value of the remaining vertices.

Question: For a given polygon, calculate the highest score.
